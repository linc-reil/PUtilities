## Introduction
### Welcome
Hello, and welcome to **PUtilities**, the ultimate utilities program for getting work done efficiently, PUtilities is built upon the programming language Python, and is designed to be easy to develop with only a limited understanding of some key concepts in programming.

The goal of PUtilities is to provide an easy to way contribute, design, develop, and use a utilities program that is lightweight, portable, flexible, and most importantly, convenient!
### Start Developing
To start developing today, I highly recommend reading at least the basic concepts within the documentation (see *documentation.md* within the PUtilities/dev directory). A limited to standard understanding is also recommended for concepts such as object oriented programming and the python module **tkinter**.
